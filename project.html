            <p class = "bio-p">This project was my first and utilized HTML and CSS. I am most proud <br> of this project
                because it was the first project I complete after thinking I could<br> never code. I made this in the summer of 
                2022 in a summer tech program. <br> The color scheme may seem familiar with the light blues.<br> Whenever
                I make a project like a resume, biography, or portfolio; I use this pallete. <br> It represents new beginnings
                and believing in myself. <br> This is the same mentality that I am taking into this project.<br>
                This project contained four sections that included: an about me ,<br>educational journey, list of skills, and a motivational video.

            <p class="jel-p">This was an independent project that focused on the basics of Python.<br> It was a simple quiz that used a point counter and utilized 
            if and else statements.<br> This project was made more recently as it was used to re-establish my coding knowledge. <br> This simple 
            test helped me with conceptualizing this language since it can be a weakpoint.<br> This was a simple quiz about jellyfish that added a point when you answered a question correctly.<br>
            When the answer was incorrect, the score would remain the same and you would miss the point.
            <br>Once the quiz was completed, the program would the return this score.<br> You could refresh the quiz if you wanted to try again for a new score<br>

            <p class = "fla-p"> This is a mock version of Flappy bird that was made using Javascript. <br>This is the hardest project I have completed on my own. There are still many bugs and problems<br> with this code, but I am still very proud of the product. It was creating an old mobile game and making it on a browser.<br>
            This will be my motivation going into the Javascript section. I am known to struggle with Javascript. <br> However, if I can complete this project, even with guided assistance. I still created this and can do much more.<br>
            This picture brought life to images and made boundaries for when the game would stop, such as hitting a pipe.<br>Like the original game, this project is a side scroller with time limits between movement frames.

            <p class = "col-p">This project required the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to be completed.<br> There is two HTML files present: one for the hex codes and one for simple colors.<br>
                For the simple page, An array was used to contain the colors in a list that was activated by a button.<br> A getRandomNumber() function was used to select a random color based on the array length (colors.length)<br>
                For the hex code page, a array was composed of the numbers of 0-9 and A-F.<br> A for statement was used that stated that i should start at 0, if i is less than 6, i++ should be added to i. <br>
                The getRandomNumber() was used and the hex.length was utilized to pull random numbers and letters until 6 characters were made.<br> A mistakle that was made is the click event listener was not solely exclusive to the button in the simple color page.
